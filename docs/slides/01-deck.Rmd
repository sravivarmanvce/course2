## Grading (cont.) {.smaller}

- Class attendance is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness 
will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.

- Exact ranges for letter grades will be curved and cutoffs will be 
determined after the final exam.

- The more evidence there is that the class has mastered the material, the 
more generous the curve will be.

## Class meetings

- Interactive

- Learn-by-doing

- Bring your laptop to class every day

## Teams

- Short survey and pretest to gauge your previous exposure to topics 
relevant to the course.

- Teams of 3-5 students for in-class activities and projects.

## Communication

Slack Demo

Q: Did you get your Slack invite?

## Computing

- R/RStudio - log on at vm-manage.oit.duke.edu

- GitHub - create account at http://github.com/ and enter info on Google doc in Slack (#github channel)

## Academic integrity

Duke Community Standard:

- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;

- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and

- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## Reusing / sharing code

- A huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of 
problems.

- Unless I explicitly tell you not to use these resource the course’s 
policy is that you may make use of these resources (e.g. StackOverflow) 
but you must explicitly cite where the code was obtained from in your 
comments.

- Any recycled coded that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will 
be treated as plagiarism.

- The one exception to this rule is that you may not directly share code 
with another team in this class, you are welcome to discuss the problems 
together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from 
another team.

## Excused absences {.smaller}

- Students who miss graded work due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious 
holiday or short-term illness should fill out an online NOVAP, RHoliday or 
short-term illness form respectively.

- If you cannot complete an assignment on the due date due to a short-term 
illness, you have until noon the following day to complete it at no 
penalty, then the regular late work policy kicks in.

- If you are faced with a personal or family emergency or a long-range or 
chronic health condition that interferes with your ability to attend or 
complete classes, you should contact your academic dean’s office. See more 
information on policies surrounding these conditions 
at https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies. 
Your academic dean can also provide more information.

## Late work policy

- late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -20%

- any later: no credit

## Policies

- Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other 
than coursework during class

- You must be in class on a day when you're scheduled to present, there are 
no make ups for presentations

- Regrade requests must be made within 3 days of when the assignment is 
returned, and must be submitted in writing

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work can be completed 
collaboratively

- Use of disallowed materials during the take home exam will not be 
tolerated
