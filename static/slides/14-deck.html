## Getting started

- Any questions from last time?

- Quality of fit and model selection

## Data: Paris Paintings

From last time...


```r
library(tidyverse) # ggplot2 + dplyr + readr + and some others
library(broom)
```


```r
# Load data
pp &lt;- read_csv("data/paris_paintings.csv", na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))

# Filter for paintings less than 5000 square inches
pp_Surf_lt_5000 &lt;- pp %&gt;%
  filter(Surface &lt; 5000)
  
# Fit model with main effects only
m_main &lt;- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving), 
             data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
             
# Fit model with main effects and interactions
m_int &lt;- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving) +
                         Surface * factor(artistliving), 
            data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
```

## `\(R^2\)`

- `\(R^2\)` is the percentage of variability in the response variable explained by the 
regression model.


```r
glance(m_main)$r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01320884
```

```r
glance(m_int)$r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.0176922
```

--

- Clearly the model with interactions has a higher `\(R^2\)`.

--

- However using `\(R^2\)` for model selection in models with multiple explanatory 
variables is not a good idea as `\(R^2\)` increases when **any** variable is added to the 
model.

---

## `\(R^2\)` - first principles

$$ R^2 =  \frac{ SS\_{Reg} }{ SS\_{Total} } = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \right) $$

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
Calculate `\(R^2\)` based on the output below.
&lt;/div&gt;


```r
anova(m_main)
```

```

## Response: log(price)
##                        Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(&gt;F)
## Surface                 1   138.5 138.537 40.6741 2.058e-10
## factor(artistliving)    1     6.8   6.810  1.9994    0.1575
## Residuals            3188 10858.4   3.406
```

---

## Adjusted `\(R^2\)`

$$ R^2\_{adj} = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \times \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1} \right), $$

where `\(n\)` is the number of cases and `\(k\)` is the number of predictors in the model

--

- Adjusted `\(R^2\)` doesn't increase if the new variable does not provide any new 
informaton or is completely unrelated.

--

- This makes adjusted `\(R^2\)` a preferable metric for model selection in multiple
regression models.

---

## In pursuit of Occam's Razor

- Occam's Razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, 
the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

- Model selection follows this principle.

- We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that
variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model.

- In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model.

---

## Comparing models

It appears that adding the interaction actually increased adjusted `\(R^2\)`, so we 
should indeed use the model with the interactions.


```r
glance(m_main)$adj.r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01258977
```

```r
glance(m_int)$adj.r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01676753
```

# Model selection

---

## Backwards elimination

- Start with **full** model (including all candidate explanatory variables and all
candidate interactions)

- Remove one variable at a time, and select the model with the highest adjusted `\(R^2\)`

- Continue until adjusted `\(R^2\)` does not increase

---

## Forward selection

- Start with **empty** model

- Add one variable (or interaction effect) at a time, and select the model with the 
highest adjusted `\(R^2\)`

- Continue until adjusted `\(R^2\)` does not increase

---

## Model selection and interaction effects

If an interaction is included in the model, the main effects of both of
those variables must also be in the model

---

## Other model selection criteria

- Adjusted `\(R^2\)` is one model selection criterion

- There are others out there (many many others!), we'll discuss some later in the 
course, and some you might see in another courses
