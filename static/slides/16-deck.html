## Confidence intervals

A plausible range of values for the population parameter is a **confidence interval**.

.pull-left[

]
.pull-right[
![net](img/16/net.png)
]

- If we report a point estimate, we probably won‚Äôt hit the exact population parameter.

- If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.

## Variability of sample statistics

- In order to construct a confidence interval we need to quantify the variability of our sample statistic.

- For example, if we want to construct a confidence interval for a population mean, we need to come up with a plausible range of values around our observsed sample mean.

- This range will depend on how precise and how accurate our sample mean is as an estimate of the population mean.

- Quantifying this requires a measurement of how much we would expect the sample mean to vary from sample to sample.
    
&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë§ Suppose you randomly sample 50 students and 5 of them are left handed. If you were to take another random sample of 50 students, how many would you expect to be left handed? Would you be surprised if only 3 of them were left handed? Would you be surprised if 40 of them were left handed?
&lt;/div&gt;

## Quantifying the variability of a sample statistic

We can quantify the variability of sample statistics using

- simulation: via bootstrapping (today)

or

- theory: via Central Limit Theorem (later in the course)

## Bootstrapping

&lt;img src="img/16/boot.png" style="float:right"&gt;

- The term **bootstrapping** comes from the phrase "pulling oneself up by one‚Äôs 
bootstraps", which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without 
any outside help.

- In this case the impossible task is estimating a population parameter, and we‚Äôll 
accomplish it using data from only the given sample.

- Note that this notion of saying something about a population parameter using 
only information from an observed sample is the crux of statistical inference, 
it is not limited to bootstrapping.

## Rent in Manhattan

On a given day, twenty 1 BR apartments were randomly selected on Craigslist Manhattan from apartments listed as "by owner" (as opposed to by a rental agency).


```r
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
manhattan &lt;- read_csv("data/manhattan.csv")
```

---

## Parameter of interest

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë§ Is the mean or the median a better measure of typical rent in Manhattan?
&lt;/div&gt;

.small[

```r
ggplot(data = manhattan, mapping = aes(x = rent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200) +
  labs(title = "Rent of one bedroom apartments in Manhattan")
```

## Observed sample vs. bootstrap population

.pull-left[
![rent-bootsamp](img/16/rent-bootsamp.png)
Sample median = $2350 üò±

.pull-right[
![rent-bootpop](img/16/rent-bootpop.png)
Population median = ‚ùì
]

## Bootstrapping scheme

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample.

2. Calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, 
proportion, slope, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples.

3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap statistics.

4. Calculate the bounds of the XX% confidence interval as the middle XX% 
of the bootstrap distribution.

## New package: `infer`

For doing simulation based inference in R:


```r
# install_github("andrewpbray/infer")
library(infer)
```

Also, let's set a seed:


```r
set.seed(20171026)
```

---

## Generate bootstrap medians


```r
rent_ci_med &lt;- manhattan %&gt;%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent) %&gt;% 
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% 
  # calculate the median of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "median")
```

Let's take a peek at `rent_ci_med` (the bootstrap distribution of medians):


```r
str(rent_ci_med)
```

```
## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	15000 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ replicate: int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ stat     : num  2175 2350 2350 2350 2450 ...
##  - attr(*, "response")= symbol rent
```

---

## Visualize the bootstrap distribution


```r
ggplot(data = rent_ci_med, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution of medians")
```

![](16-deck_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Calculate the confidence interval


```r
rent_ci_med %&gt;%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   lower_bound upper_bound
##         &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      2162.5        2875
```

## Interpret the confidence interval

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë• The 95% confidence interval for the median rent of one bedroom apartments in Manhattan was calculated as (2162.5, 2875). Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this interval?
&lt;/div&gt;

(a) 95% of the time the median rent one bedroom apartments in this sample is between $2162.5 and $2875.

(b) 95% of all one bedroom apartments in Manhattan have rents between $2162.5 and $2875.

(c) We are 95% confident that the median rent of all one bedroom apartments is between $2162.5 and $2875.

(d) We are 95% confident that the median rent one bedroom apartments in this sample is between $2162.5 and $2875.

# Accuracy vs. precision

## Confidence level

- Suppose we took many samples from the original population and built a 95% confidence interval based on each sample.

- Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

- Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90%, 95%, and 99%.

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë§ Which line represents which confidence level?
&lt;/div&gt;

## Precision vs. accuracy

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë• If we want to be very certain that we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider interval or a narrower interval? What drawbacks are associated with using a wider interval?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë§ How can we get best of both worlds -- high precision and high accuracy?
&lt;/div&gt;

---

## Calculating confidence intervals at various confidence levels

&lt;div class="question"&gt;
üë• How would you modify the following code to calculate a 90% confidence interval? How would you modify it for a 99% confidence interval?
&lt;/div&gt;


```r
manhattan %&gt;%
  specify(response = rent) %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% 
  calculate(stat = "median") %&gt;%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
